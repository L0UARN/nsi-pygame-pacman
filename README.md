# NSI Pygame Pacman
A Pacman clone made in Python using Pygame

## DISCLAIMER: This project's code is a mess. When I made this, I rushed it probably a bit too much, and now it really isn't clean. This shouldn't represent the way I am now programming games. I will not take the time to clean it up, since it was made for a school project and nothing else will come out of it.
